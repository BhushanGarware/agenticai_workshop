        "[Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview) is a managed service that helps you to build and deploy an agent framework. It gives you the flexibility to choose how much reasoning you want to delegate to the LLM and how much you want to handle with customized code. Agent Engine integrates closely with the Python SDK for the Gemini model in Vertex AI, and it can manage prompts, agents, and examples in a modular way. Agent Engine is compatible with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or other Python frameworks.\n"
